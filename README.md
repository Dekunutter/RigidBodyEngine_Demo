# RigidBodyEngine_Demo
Source code for a small demo I made of my Java 3D physics engine. Not perfect, not technically complete, but at a stable place currently. Hope to return to it in the future and create more stable versions and more complex shape handling.
Coded while studying Game Physics Engine Design by Ian Millington.
Rendered with OpenGL (wrapped into Java code via LWJGL 2.9.0)

Source code will not run out of the box due to LWJGL dependencies. Install LWJGL 2.9.0 to run this project!

I'm not any kind of expect in physics, I just wanted to learn a bit more on the subject :)
